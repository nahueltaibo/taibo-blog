description: In this post I'll share everything I learn while making a garage
  shelving unit that also incorporates a workbench on wheels, to allow using the
  complete garage as a workshop, and at the same time leaving space for the car
  when stored.

W﻿e recently moved to a new house, and as usual there are plenty projects to tackle. But to be able to succeed in most of them, you need a nice place to work! Because if it, I decided to add some shelving with an integrated workbench.

I﻿ think the outcome was nice, so I want to share that with you in case you are in need for something similar. I do recommend this build particularly if you have really little extra space in the garage as it is my case.

L﻿ist of materials:
- 2 Plywood 1/2" x 4' x 8'
- 10 2" x 2" x 8'
- 6 2" x 4" x 8'
- 4 3" wheel (4" total height) casters with break
- 1 pegboard 4' x 4'
- 2 1" x 2" X 8' (used as pegboard frame)

T﻿he first part we'll make is the workbench, so we can use it later to build the shelves.

I﻿ used this draw to cut the parts, particularly usefull for the table top and shelve. And allows you to see that both plywood sheets will be cut in half on the longer side, and one of those halfs will be cut in the middle on its shorter side.
