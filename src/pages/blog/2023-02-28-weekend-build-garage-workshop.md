description: In this post I'll share everything I learn while making a garage
  shelving unit that also incorporates a workbench on wheels, to allow using the
  complete garage as a workshop, and at the same time leaving space for the car
  when stored.

W﻿e recently moved to a new house, and as usual there are plenty projects to tackle. But to be able to succeed in most of them, you need a nice place to work! Because if it, I decided to add some shelving with an integrated workbench.

I﻿ think the outcome was nice, so I want to share that with you in case you are in need for something similar. I do recommend this build particularly if you have really little extra space in the garage as it is my case.
